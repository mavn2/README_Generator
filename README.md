A lightweight, easy to use CLI app for quickly producing well-formatted README.md files for coding projects.

Once you've run the application and generated a readme, feel free to further tweak it to suit your needs.  I used the app to create this readme, then added in the images you've seen above.

Be mindful of the fact that, since you will likely be moving the created README file to a relevant folder and because convention does not allow using the project name in the README title, the application will rewrite any README.md files in its directory every time it is run.

## License

Use of this application is governed by the MIT license.

## Contributing

The app was written to be simple to understand and easy to modify. Feel free to make changes to the app to better meet your README needs.

## Tests

Functionality is fairly straightforward, and development on this project was conceptual rather than test driven. If you want to ensure the application works, simply try using it!
